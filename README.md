# 🪙 SOLVENT

**An AI agent that runs as a profitable, self-funding business.**

It sells research briefs. It collects payment on Stripe. It spends its own revenue to provision the compute it needs. And it refuses any job that doesn't clear a margin.

> **Demo by default.** `pip install solvent-agent` and `solvent` run an **offline, zero-key simulation** of that loop. Dollar figures in the demo are illustrative — **not production revenue**. Stripe test-mode Payment Links and live NVIDIA Nemotron are opt-in; see [Make It Real](#-make-it-real).

## The Big Idea

Most agents can spend money. Almost none can **run as a business.**

SOLVENT closes the full loop:

```
  Client pays Stripe → Agent earns revenue → Agent fulfils the work
  → Agent pays its own vendor bills → P&L booked → balance sheet grows
```

Every job is **profit-gated before it starts**. Unprofitable work is declined without touching Stripe. Vendor payments are screened by a NemoClaw-style policy sandbox. The agent literally cannot spend more than it earns.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Zero dependencies. No API keys. Works right now.**

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install solvent-agent
# or, for an isolated CLI install:
pipx install solvent-agent

solvent                          # run the demo
solvent finance                  # financial report (income, runway, forecast)
solvent doctor                   # stack diagnostics (keys, extras, workspace)
solvent --help                   # list all commands
solvent --version
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `solvent` | batch demo (onboarding wizard on first run) |
| `solvent init` | create data dirs, treasury DB, and workspace files |
| `solvent status` | live treasury summary (`--watch` to auto-refresh) |
| `solvent finance` | income statement, unit economics, runway, forecast |
| `solvent doctor` | diagnostics: API keys, extras, workspace files |
| `solvent serve` | webhooks + job API + hosted dashboard (`[serve]` extra) |
| `solvent worker` | resume incomplete jobs / process the queue |
| `solvent jobs` | list / show / retry / cancel jobs (`jobs --help`) |

Or clone and run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianalloway/solvent-agent.git
cd solvent-agent
python3 run_demo.py              # batch demo (onboarding wizard on first run)
python3 run_demo.py --no-onboard # skip wizard when scripting
pip install -e .                 # editable install from a checkout
```

The agent will run a full batch of 5 analyst jobs — complete with margin gating, Stripe payment simulation, NVIDIA Nemotron fulfillment, guardrail screening, and live P&L — in about 30 seconds.

Third-party features are **opt-in extras** — install only what you need:

```bash
pip install "solvent-agent[stripe]"    # real Stripe test-mode payment links
pip install "solvent-agent[serve]"     # FastAPI webhooks + hosted briefs
pip install "solvent-agent[telegram]"  # Telegram bot channel
pip install "solvent-agent[qr]"        # scannable QR codes for OpenClaw pairing
pip install "solvent-agent[dev]"       # pytest, for running the test suite
pip install "solvent-agent[all]"       # everything
```

When run from a source checkout, runtime data stays under `<repo>/data`. When
installed elsewhere, SOLVENT writes to `~/.solvent` instead of into
`site-packages` — override either with `SOLVENT_HOME=/path/to/dir`.

> **First run**: A short onboarding wizard asks you to choose a model, interaction mode, and whether to enable Stripe test mode. Preferences are saved to `.solvent/config.json` and never committed.

---

## 📊 The Demo

After a run, the CLI prints the dashboard path. Open it in a browser:

```bash
open treasury_dashboard.html          # macOS (source checkout)
xdg-open treasury_dashboard.html      # Linux
# pip/pipx install: ~/.solvent/treasury_dashboard.html  (or $SOLVENT_HOME)
```

![SOLVENT Treasury Dashboard — live P&L, job cards, resource allocation, transaction log](docs/dashboard.png)

A typical **offline demo** batch (illustrative numbers from the simulated run — not production revenue):

| Metric | Demo value |
|---|---|
| Revenue | $348.00 |
| Operating spend | $2.20 |
| Net profit | $345.80 (99.4% margin) |
| Jobs completed | 4 of 5 |
| Jobs declined | 1 (below the $15 minimum order size) |

> **Why operating spend is so low.** The margin gate quoted ~$33 of fulfilment
> cost across those four jobs, but only $2.20 was booked. The offline stub
> answers without calling the `market_data` or `web_search` tools, so those
> line items bill zero — the agent pays for the tokens, the PDF render and the
> delivery, and nothing else. That gap is a property of the stub, not a
> business result: with live inference and live tools both columns move, and
> the margin lands near the ~88–92% the gate projected. `solvent finance`
> reports the same figures from the ledger.

```

Revenue is **always collected before cost is incurred**, and no payment can violate policy. The business is safe by construction and profitable by rule.

## 🏗️ Architecture

| Layer | Technology | File |
|---|---|---|
| **Analyst / reasoning** | NVIDIA Nemotron (Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra) | `solvent/nemotron.py` |
| **Spend safety** | NVIDIA NemoClaw-style policy sandbox | `solvent/guardrails.py` |
| **Earn** | Stripe Payment Links + Checkout Session polling | `solvent/stripe_client.py` |
| **Spend** | Stripe Issuing virtual cards (test mode) | `solvent/stripe_client.py` |
| **Orchestration** | Hermes / Nous tool-calling agent loop | `solvent/agent.py` |
| **Memory** | SQLite treasury + pricing ledger | `solvent/treasury.py` · `solvent/pricing.py` |

**Key design choices:**

- **Structural profitability** — `pricing.py` computes unit cost before quoting. If margin < floor, the job never reaches Stripe.
- **Spend policy** — `guardrails.py` enforces vendor allowlist, per-transaction cap, rolling 24h budget, minimum cash reserve, and no-negative-ROI rule.
- **Offline-first** — without API keys the demo runs on deterministic stubs. Add `NVIDIA_API_KEY` + `STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_...` to unlock live inference and real Payment Links.
- **Audit trail** — every `cs_...` checkout session ID and `pi_...` PaymentIntent ID is recorded on the ledger before fulfilment begins.

## 🎮 Running Modes

### Batch demo (default — best for judges)

```bash
python3 run_demo.py
```

5 pre-loaded jobs (4 accepted, 1 declined). ~30 seconds. Shows margin gating, Stripe earn/spend, Nemotron fulfillment, and guardrails in action.

### Interactive — your own jobs

```bash
python3 run_demo.py --interactive
```

Type a research topic and client budget at the prompt. The agent quotes, pays, fulfils, and books P&L for each one in real time. Keep going until you quit.

### Add funds mid-session

```bash
python3 run_demo.py --seed 500        # start with $500 instead of $100
python3 run_demo.py --keep-balance    # resume existing treasury balance
```

In interactive mode, type `/fund 200` at the prompt to deposit $200 into the live treasury without restarting.

### Programmatic

```python
from solvent.agent import Solvent
from solvent.jobs import SAMPLE_JOBS

agent = Solvent(seed_cents=10_000)  # reset treasury, seed $100
agent.handle_job(SAMPLE_JOBS[0])  # process one job
snap = agent.run(SAMPLE_JOBS[1:])  # process a list; returns snapshot

print(snap["balance_cents"], snap["margin_pct"])
```

### Production mode (webhooks + async worker)

```bash
pip install "solvent-agent[serve]"
export SOLVENT_DASHBOARD_TOKEN=$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')

python3 -m solvent serve --port 8787   # webhooks + job API + hosted briefs
python3 -m solvent worker              # resume incomplete jobs, process queue

# Interactive voice dashboard (chat + live SSE updates):
open "http://127.0.0.1:8787/?token=$SOLVENT_DASHBOARD_TOKEN"
```

The hosted dashboard at `/` includes a **chat panel** (type or use the mic with Web Speech API) and **live treasury updates** via Server-Sent Events (`/api/events`). Dashboard/control routes require `SOLVENT_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` via `?token=...` or the `X-Solvent-Dashboard-Token` header before they expose status data or route chat through the Nemotron agent loop.

See [docs/PRODUCTION.md](docs/PRODUCTION.md) for Stripe webhook setup, SMTP delivery, and reconciliation.

### Operations

```bash
python3 -m solvent quote "AI inference chips, 2026" --budget 49   # dry-run the margin gate
python3 -m solvent backlog                # rank open jobs by return on capital
python3 -m solvent guardrails             # spend policy in force + vendor exposure
python3 -m solvent reconcile --since 7d   # Stripe ↔ ledger drift check
python3 -m solvent finance                # income statement, unit economics, runway
python3 -m solvent finance --json         # machine-readable report
python3 -m solvent finance --reserve 50   # runway to a $50 cash-reserve floor
python3 -m solvent finance --period week  # net P&L trend by day | week | month
python3 -m solvent finance --horizon 60   # forecast the balance 60 days out
```

`finance` (alias `report`) turns the treasury ledger into the numbers a
business steers by: revenue/cost/net-margin, average profit per job, a cash
**runway** — days of burn remaining, or `cash-flow positive` once the agent
funds itself — a **net-P&L trend** bucketed by day/week/month, and a
**balance forecast** (central projection with a best/worst band whose width
grows with daily volatility). The income statement, runway, trend, and
forecast also render as a **Financial Statement** panel in the HTML dashboard.

## 🧭 Commercial Judgement

Three things turn the money loop into something that behaves like a shop
rather than a script.

### Counter-offers — a decline is a negotiating position

The margin gate still refuses work it cannot do profitably, but it no longer
just says no. Every decline carries the deal the agent *would* accept:

```bash
python3 -m solvent quote "Edge-AI in industrial robotics" --budget 8 --tokens 30000
```

```
  Projected margin     $-4.33 (-54.1%)   floor 35.0%
  Verdict              DECLINE — order $8 below minimum order size $15

  Counter-offer        $19.00 at 35.1% margin
    can deliver this brief as specified for $19.00
```

Two shapes, in order of preference: a **narrower scope** the customer's
existing budget can buy (fewer market-data pulls first — they are the priciest
resource), or, when no sellable scope fits, the **lowest price** that clears
the margin floor. The offer is emitted as a `counter_offer` event next to the
decline, so any channel — terminal, Telegram, the job API — can quote it back.
`solvent quote` runs the whole gate as a dry run: nothing is written to the
treasury, no Stripe call is made, and the exit code is 1 on a decline so
scripts can gate on the verdict.

### Spend policy — bounding *how* money moves, not just how much

The guardrails gained two rules that shape the distribution of spend:

| Rule | What it stops |
|---|---|
| **Per-vendor 24h cap** | one vendor — compromised, mispriced, or just buggy — absorbing the whole day's budget |
| **Spend velocity** | a fulfilment loop that starts paying in a tight cycle, long before it drains the treasury |

Limits are operator-tunable without touching code, via
`.solvent/spend_policy.json` (a malformed file is ignored rather than allowed
to widen the policy):

```json
{
  "daily_budget_cents": 50000,
  "per_vendor_daily_cents": 8000,
  "max_txns_per_hour": 40,
  "vendor_daily_overrides": { "market-data-api": 15000 }
}
```

`python3 -m solvent guardrails` prints the policy in force, how much of each
rolling window is used, per-vendor exposure against its cap, and every spend
the policy blocked.

### Backlog — which job to work on next

A queue is not a plan. When several jobs are open and both cash and the 24h
spend budget are finite, the order the agent works in decides what it earns.
`python3 -m solvent backlog` ranks the open work the way a business would —
and the async worker consumes the same ranking:

1. **Finish what is already paid for.** Revenue is collected before cost is
   incurred, so a paid job left unfinished is a refund waiting to happen.
2. **Then best return on capital** — margin per cent of fulfilment cost, so a
   $20 job costing $5 outranks a $90 job costing $60.
3. **Never start work the treasury cannot fund.** A job whose fulfilment would
   breach the spend budget or the cash reserve is *deferred* until the
   treasury can pay for it — where the quote stage would otherwise decline it
   permanently — and a cheaper job behind it can still take the remaining
   capacity.

```
  #  JOB         STATUS                    PRICE     COST    ROI  TOPIC
  1  J4          awaiting_payment         $99.00    $8.07  11.27   Edge-AI adoption in industri
  2  J5          awaiting_payment        $125.00   $10.41  11.01   Unit economics of autonomous
    ⏸ J2: fulfilment needs 845c; only 200c of spend capacity left (24h budget / cash reserve)
```

## 🔑 Make It Real

To use live Nemotron inference and real Stripe test-mode payment links:

```bash
pip install "solvent-agent[stripe]"

export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-...        # from build.nvidia.com
export STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_...      # Stripe test mode only (live keys refused)

python3 run_demo.py
```

With both keys set:

- Briefs are written by **NVIDIA Nemotron** (Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra).
- Each job creates a real **Stripe Payment Link**. Pay with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
- SOLVENT **polls** the Checkout Session (`cs_...`) until `payment_status == paid` before fulfilling — no instant confirm.
- Optional: set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and forward `checkout.session.completed` events via `StripeClient.process_webhook()`.
- Optional: enable **Stripe Issuing** on your test account to provision capped single-use virtual debit cards for each vendor payment.

### Environment variables

| `SOLVENT_WORKSPACE_TOTAL_MAX_CHARS` | Max total characters across all workspace context files (default `40000`) |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname. When empty (default), brief delivery is **simulated** — research briefs are written to the outbox directory instead of emailed. When set, briefs are emailed to the customer |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port (default `587`) |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP authentication username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP authentication password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | "From" address for outgoing brief emails (default: `SMTP_USER`, else `agent@solvent.local`) |

Product/Price objects are cached in `.solvent/stripe_catalog.json` so repeated runs reuse a single **SOLVENT Research Brief** product instead of cluttering your Stripe dashboard.

## 💬 Telegram (conversational channel)

Full chat on Telegram with OpenClaw-style pairing and Hermes-style tool/memory patterns. See **[docs/TELEGRAM.md](docs/TELEGRAM.md)**.

```bash
pip install "solvent-agent[telegram]"
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...

python -m solvent serve &    # Stripe webhooks + checkout
python -m solvent worker &   # fulfill jobs
python -m solvent telegram     # long-poll bot

python -m solvent doctor       # diagnostics
python -m solvent pairing list # pending DM codes
```

Users pair via `/start`, commission briefs in natural language, receive checkout links, and get push updates when jobs are paid and delivered.

Personality and operating rules come from the **agent workspace** (`SOUL.md`, `BRAIN.md`, `AGENTS.md`) — see **[docs/WORKSPACE.md](docs/WORKSPACE.md)**.

## 🏆 Built For

**Hermes Agent Accelerated Business Hackathon** — NVIDIA × Stripe × Nous Research

The agent was designed to demonstrate:

- An agent that is **economically self-aware** — it has a treasury, prices against its own costs, and gates every action on projected profit
- A **complete two-sided Stripe integration** — earns via Payment Links, spends via Issuing virtual cards
- **Provable spend safety** — a NemoClaw-style policy sandbox that makes "give an agent a payment credential" a reasonable thing to do
- **Live inference with NVIDIA Nemotron** — the offline stub means the demo always works, even without API keys

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues, PRs, and ideas are very welcome. Some good starting points:

- Add more sample research topics in `solvent/jobs.py`
- Improve the Nemotron prompt template in `solvent/service.py`
- Add a new guardrail policy to `solvent/guardrails.py`
- Extend the dashboard with charts or new metrics in `solvent/dashboard.py`
