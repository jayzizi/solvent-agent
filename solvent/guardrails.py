"""
guardrails.py — the NemoClaw-style spend safety layer.

Every time SOLVENT wants to move money, the request passes through here first.
This is the "run agents safely" piece: an autonomous agent with a Stripe key is
dangerous unless its spending is bounded. These guardrails are deterministic,
auditable, and run BEFORE any Stripe call.

Rules enforced:
  1. Vendor allowlist        — money can only go to pre-approved vendors.
  2. Per-transaction cap      — no single spend over a ceiling.
  3. Daily spend budget       — total spend in a rolling 24h window is bounded.
  4. Per-vendor daily cap     — no single vendor can absorb the whole budget.
  5. Spend velocity           — bounded number of payments per rolling hour.
  6. Solvency rule            — never spend below a minimum cash reserve.
  7. ROI rule                 — never spend on a job whose projected margin is negative.

Rules 1-3 and 6-7 bound *how much* the agent can spend; rules 4 and 5 bound
*how it is distributed*. A single compromised or misbehaving vendor cannot
drain the day's budget on its own, and a fulfilment loop that starts paying in
a tight cycle trips the velocity rule long before it empties the treasury.

In production these checks would be enforced inside NVIDIA NemoClaw's sandbox so
the model literally cannot emit an out-of-policy payment. Here we implement the
same policy in plain Python so the behaviour is visible and testable.
